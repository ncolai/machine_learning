# machine_learning
My past and current work in machine learning. Most projects are practice, while some may be of practical use.

A brief synopsis:

-andrew_ng_ml represents my having worked through Coursera's Machine Learning course. DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of the original code, and I will not (and probably won't need to) use any code therein for personal benefit.
-kaggle represents my data science competition attempts. I generally try to keep my code clean, but since this is competition programming, this represents a lower standard of cleanliness than my typical work. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments about anything in here! I'm open to new perspectives as long as they're not malicious :) .
