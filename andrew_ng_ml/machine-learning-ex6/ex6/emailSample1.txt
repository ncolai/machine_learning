Nicholas,

Attached is the pdf of the your travel reservation to HK in case you need it.

It reminded to bring all necessary documentation (e.g. passport, visa, etc.)

The print out has the information to check in to get your boarding pass.

Shanghai has two airports. The one that you should go to is Pudong International Airport (PVG), in case that is not obvious.

You need to go to the China Eastern Airlines counter to check-in, and show them your passport. On  the print-out it has your name (Nicholas Lai) and China Eastern Airlines confirmation/booking number (MTQ6XX).

Since the departure time is 1:15pm, I recommend you be there around 10:30am (or earlier). It is always good to be in the airport early so that you can relax and wait.

Ask hotel how long is the ride to airport. If it takes an hr, then you check out ~ 9:30am.. You get the picture.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dad
